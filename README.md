# ShutTheBox

This is a python program which uses backwards induction (dynamic programming) to solve the expected value of a given board where a win is 1.0, a draw is 0.5 and a loss is worth 0.0 points. The program accepts arguments for two players and can also be given arguemnts to give back the optimal move for a player given a board and their last roll.
